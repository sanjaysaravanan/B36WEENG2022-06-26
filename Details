    this can be handled by overflow prop for parent.

    Overflow:

      visible ( defautl ) ---> overflow and UI will not be nice 
      hidden ---> Hides the overflow for the user
      scroll ---> Create a scroll/scroll track irrespective overflow
      auto ---> Create a scroll-bar only when is there is a overflow

    flex

      container controls the alignment of the children

      justisy-content ( start, end, center, space-around, space-between, space-evenly ), align-items (start, end, center)

      flex-direction: row/Column
        row:
          justify-content - used to align horizontaly
          aling-items - used to align vertically

        Column:
          justify-content - used to align vertically
          aling-items - used to align horizonatlly

    grid:
      Make a div to have it children in grid like structure
        grid-template-columns: auto auto auto auto; creates four columns
